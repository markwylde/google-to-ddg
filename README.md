When Google decides to CAPTCHA block you, show buttons that direct you to alternative search engines.

## Why?

I have my default search engine set to DuckDuckGo, but sometimes when I'm in a rush, I'll just try and go straight to Google, using the hash bang.

I frequently get CAPTCHA's on Google, and as I refuse to solve them, it means I have to retype in my search query.

This extension puts links to some better search engines at the top of the Google CAPTCHA page.
